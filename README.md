# Housing Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices using multiple regression algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and model deployment.

## Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Feature Scaling with StandardScaler  
- Multiple Regression Models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Gaussian Process Regressor  
  - Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)  
  - XGBoost  
- Cross-validation with KFold  
- Model Evaluation using R² Score  
- Best Model Exported as `gbr.pkl`
